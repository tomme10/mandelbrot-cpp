# MandelBrotCpp
This project is complete with a 19200x10800 png image of the mandlebrot set, and the main.cpp file included generates the same image in about 5-10 minutes on my machine.

The algorithm is able to generate larger images, But I had some memory errors while doing so and I don't know enough about c++ to fix them

It used lodePNG to write the image to disk
